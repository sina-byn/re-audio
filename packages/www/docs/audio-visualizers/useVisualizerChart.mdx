The `useVisualizerChart` hook returns a tuple `[amplitude, pending]`:

- `amplitude` is an array of numbers representing the **inverted amplitude** of the currently playing audio track, suitable for visualizing waveforms or bar charts.
- `pending` is a boolean indicating whether the audio data is still being fetched and processed.

This hook accepts an optional `dataPoints` parameter, which defaults to `64` if not specified. This value determines the number of points in the `amplitude` array, effectively controlling the resolution of the visualized waveform.

The hook automatically handles:

- Fetching and decoding the current track.
- Calculating the average amplitude in each block.
- Running the computation in a Web Worker to avoid blocking the main thread.
- Cleaning up workers and aborting fetches when the track changes.
