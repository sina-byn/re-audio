The `useVisualizer` hook returns an `AudioAnalyserRef` that wraps an [`AudioAnalyser`](/docs/api#audio-analyser) instance.

You can call the `getFrequencyData()` on the provided ref to retrieve an array of integers ranging from 0 to 255.
This array represents the real-time frequency data of the currently playing track, allowing you to visualize the audio frequencies effectively.

This hook accepts an optional `dataPoints` parameter, which defaults to `64` if not specified. This value determines the length of the array returned by `getFrequencyData()`.
