# Audio Visualizers

---

### useVisualizer

The `useVisualizer` hook returns an `AudioAnalyserRef` that wraps an [`AudioAnalyser`](/docs/api#audio-analyser) instance.

You can call the `getFrequencyData()` on the provided ref to retrieve an array of integers ranging from 0 to 255.
This array represents the real-time frequency data of the currently playing track, allowing you to visualize the audio frequencies effectively.

### useVisualizerFrame

The `useVisualizerFrame` hook is a wrapper around the `useVisualizer` hook that integrates the `getFrequencyData` function with `requestAnimationFrame()`.
It returns a `frame`, which is a `number[]` representing the frequency data as a React state.

This frame updates in real-time as the audio plays, allowing you to render your visualizer without any additional concerns about data management or updates.
